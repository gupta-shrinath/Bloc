* Bloc is a to-do application that runs on your local ethereum blockchain.
* Bloc uses smart-contracts and web3 js to talk to your local ethereum blockchain.

## Dependencies
* Bootstrap 4.5.2
* Jquery 3.5.1
* Web3 1.2.11
* Solidity ^0.5.1
* Ganache 2.4.0.1317

## Install 
- Download [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) for local ethereum blockchain.
  - Click on Quickstart Ethereum and after that note the address labeled under RPC Server 
    (should be something like this http://127.0.0.1:7545) and make sure to copy the same 
address in `js/getAccount.js` file line 1.
- Go to [Remix IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org/) click on the plus icon in the file explorers
located in the left panel and name the file as bloc.sol (Make sure to sure http site not https).
    - Copy the code present in bloc.sol from this repo.
    - Go to solidity compiler located in the left panel and click on compile bloc.sol.
      down you'll find a button with copy icon and text as ABI click on it.Paste it in 
      `js/config.js` line 1<br>
      >let contractABI = `COPIED TEXT`;<br>
      The copied text will be enclosed in [].
    - Go to deploy and run transaction under environment select Web3 Provider. 
    - If you get the message `Not possible to connect to the Web3 provider. Make sure the provider is running, a connection is open (via IPC or RPC) or that       the provider plugin is properly configured.` this is due to CORS policy in browsers.
    - The solution for chrome browser is go to `chrome://flags/#block-insecure-private-network-requests` and select disabled. Relaunch the browser. Disabling       that flag does mean you're re-opening the security hole that Chrome's new behavior is meant to close.You can read more [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66534759/chrome-cors-error-on-request-to-localhost-dev-server-from-remote-site)
    - Enter the address you copied from Ganache and paste it click on OK.
    - Now a deploy button will be visible click on it. 
    - Down you'll find Deployed Contracts label now there will a copy icon button click on it   
      and paste in `js/config.js` line 2
      >let contractAddress = `'COPIED text'`;<br>
      The copied text might look like this 0xF3017acEDd45526aC6153FBBCfcA8096173D245a.
- Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for live server extension (any other 
server will also work)
- Go to Extensions on the left panel search for live server and install it.
- Open the folder containing this repo and down in the blue status bar and click on Go live.
